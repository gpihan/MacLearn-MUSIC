# This folder contains all the model already trained.
The trained models are pickle files made with the MacLearnModels wrapper generated by the 
GenerateModelsObject class. 
They contain a loaded and trained model ready to use for predictions on 2D numpy array. 

They also contain metadata dictionary:
- For their parameters under the key "ModelParameters"
- For its model type under the key "ModelType"
- For their prediction type under the key "PredictionType" 
- For the system collisions they were trained on under the key "CollisionsSystem"
- For the parameters of the collisions system "3dMCGlauberParameters"
